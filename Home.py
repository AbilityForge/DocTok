**DocTok** is designed to improve how users interact with technical documentation. 
Traditional methods of searching through manuals, guides, or extensive documentation often prove time-consuming and inefficient. 
DocTok addresses this by transforming static documents into a dynamic conversational experience.

The project originated from the need to bridge the gap between vast technical data and user accessibility, focusing on 
creating a seamless interface where users can query documents as they would in a conversation.
