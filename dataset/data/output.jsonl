In LangChain JS/TS, the default is to block for a short period of time for the trace to finish due to the greater popularity of serverless environments.

Log your first trace Tracing to LangSmith for LangChain usersThere is no need to use the LangSmith SDK directly if your application is built entirely on LangChain (either Python and JS).We've outlined a tracing guide specifically for LangChain users here. We provide multiple ways to log traces to LangSmith. Below, we'll highlight\nhow to use traceable. See more on the Annotate code for tracing page.
